# Gasteizko Rap Player

This music player is a tribute to the rap music from Vitoria and its surroundings from the 2000s, which was a significant part of my childhood. The tracks featured here are reminiscent of those times and bring back many memories.

**Note to Artists:** If any artist comes across this and wishes for their track to be removed, please do not hesitate to contact me at [iker@ikerocio.com](mailto:iker@ikerocio.com).

This project is based on [WilsonLe's react-music-player](https://github.com/WilsonLe/react-music-player) with some enhancements. It operates entirely on the frontend without the need for a backend.
